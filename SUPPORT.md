# Support

Curitics Health maintains several private repositories and selectively publishes tools or packages.

For public repositories:

- Open a GitHub Issue for bugs or feature requests  
- Check existing discussions before creating new ones  
- PRs are welcome if aligned with our contribution guidelines  

We currently do not offer real-time or commercial support via GitHub.
