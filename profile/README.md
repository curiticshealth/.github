# Curitics Health

Building the engineering platform powering value-based care at scale.

We design and operate a multi-tenant healthcare data platform that brings together eligibility, claims, clinical data, attribution logic, and workflow engines—built with security, correctness, and operational excellence at the core.

## 🛠️ Our Engineering Stack

We work with a modern, pragmatic, and highly reliable stack designed for healthcare-grade systems:

### **Backend & Application**
- **Laravel / PHP 8+**
- **FilamentPHP** for internal admin experiences
- **Node.js** for selective services and automation
- **Python** for data workflows and ETL tasks

### **Data Platform**
- **PostgreSQL** with **RLS**, advanced indexing, and multi-tenant isolation
- **AWS Redshift** for analytical workloads
- **S3-based ingest pipelines** for bulk file workflows
- **Metabase & internal dashboards** for data observability

### **Infrastructure**
- **AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, SQS, SNS, Lambda, SES, CloudWatch)**
- **Laravel Vapor** for serverless deployments
- **Docker-based pipelines** for local + CI tooling
- **Terraform/IaC adoption in progress**

### **Frontend**
- **TailwindCSS**, **Blade**, **HTMX**, **Alpine.js**
- **Filament widgets** for complex internal UI modules

### **AI & Automation**
- LLM-assisted internal tooling  
- Background data quality agents  
- Automated ingestion + validation pipelines

## 🔒 Engineering Principles

- **Security First**  
  RLS everywhere, strict tenancy boundaries, principle of least privilege.

- **Data Integrity Over Speed**  
  Every pipeline is deterministic, auditable, and replay-safe.

- **Operational Clarity**  
  Simple deploys, predictable queues, structured monitoring.

- **Reliable by Design**  
  We value boring, stable engineering over clever complexity.

- **Developer Happiness**  
  Clear conventions, automated processes, clean tooling.
